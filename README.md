# mandelbrot
An interactive Mandlebrot-set generator utilizing the C pthread library for calculations and a Java swing GUI for interaction.

Programmed by Micah Adams, Jeremy Klyn, and Jay Timmer.

USAGE
=========
The repository contains a script to automatically compile and run the GUI interface. Naviagte to /mandlebrot/src/javaGUI. Set run permissions on the file `run` and execute the file. You will need `gcc`, `java`, and `javac`, available in your PATH for this stript to execute correctly.

Command Line
------------
Compile the mandelbrotcalculator.c code with `gcc -o CompiledMandelbrot mandlebrotcalculator.c -lthread -lm`. You can then run `CompiledMandelbrot [xmin] [xmax] [ymin] [ymax]` to calculate the Mandelbrot set between the given x and y coordinates. 

TO-DO
===========
**High priority**
- ~~Extensive code cleanup~~
- ~~Independent command line operation~~
- ~~Create compilation scripts and remove calling of GCC in the swing GUI~~

Low Priority
- ~~Automatically update GUI without window resize~~
